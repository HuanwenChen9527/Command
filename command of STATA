Calculate the merge effect size: the total OR command
gen logOR=log(OR)
Gen selogOR = (log (uci) - log (lci))/(2 * 1.96)
Metan logOR selogOR,label(namevar=firstauthor) random eform xlabel (0.01,0.25,0.5, 1, 2,4,10) force textsize (100)
Metan logOR selogOR,label(namevar=firstauthor) random eform xlabel (0.01,0.1,1,10,100) force textsize (100)
Publish bias commands

Sensitivity analysis

Meta-regression analysis
metareg logOR studydesign, wsse(selogOR) bsest(reml) graph eform
Note: Meta-regression analysis is a means to mine the heterogeneity of meaningful associations to see if the source of heterogeneity can be found. Since regression analysis can only operate on numerical variables, digital transformation of subgroup information should be carried out. If the project study design will be carried out in the calculation of each case-control study and cohort study conversion (0=cohort study, 1=case-control study)
Interpretation of results: The corresponding P&gt of study design; The value of ItI is the P-value, and when the P-value is less than 0.05, it is statistically significant, and study design is one of the sources of heterogeneity. If P value is greater than 0.05, there is no statistical significance, so study Design is not the source of heterogeneity of this association.
Meta analysis was performed on dichotomous variables
